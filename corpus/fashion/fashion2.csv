I like that whole hippie, bohemian look.","I've noticed neon colors are coming back as well.","I won't wear neon, it's just too bright. I have seen some really pretty choker necklaces though.","I would totally wear those, I've seen them too in so many different styles and colors.","Have you seen Betsy Johnson's new line?","No,not yet, looks like I will have to google it and take a look.","She's got so many cute shirts, purses and pajamas.","",""

You're right, though who would have thought a bird pattern? Parrots at that!","What did you think of the trench coat dress on Priyanka Chopra? Can you believe it was Ralph Lauren? Really dramatic but I kind of liked it.","Yeah, me too. Who would have thought a British khaki at the Met Ball? The collar is what really does it for me.","I also liked the black dress Dakota Johnson was in. Gucci always has something worth mentioning.","Yeah, I liked it too. Cut out seems to big this year. It was a very dramatic dress and probably one of my favorites.","Laura Osnes reminded of that beautiful blue grey dress that Kerry wore in Sex In The City towards the end. The skirt with all that texture that looks like flowers is so beautiful.","I know, right? I even like the shade of pink matched with the black. Normally not a fan, too 80's but this looked really good to me too.","What was Claire Danes thinking? I did not like the weirdly dramatic white top with laced black pants.","Yeah, that outfit was a bust but even worst was her make up. Where did her eyebrows go? Normally she looks great, but I guess she was going for ""artsy"" being at the Met.","It reminded me of Tracee Ellis Ross in Comme des Garcons thing. What was it a bag or a dress or coat?","I wouldn't say it was the best, but I think Rhianna had the most interesting outfit. The texture and color was pretty and crazy at the same time!","Yeah that was totally weird and unflattering but I did like the color. It was almost electric!","What about Cara Delevigne Chanel outfit? All that shiny silvery material. What was it made of?","No idea, but what was the thing on head, was it sprayed in her hair or like a skullcap? I don't know what she was thinking.","Did you see Katy Perry in Maison Margiela? The red was totally shocking because the was so much of it.","Yeah, she almost looked like a ghost and flamigo dancer had a baby. I'm not sure that was winner but I did  like the boldness of the red.","I really liked Laura Dern in Gabriela Hearst. It was a beautiful navy gown with cut-outs, very slimming!","Yes, navy is such a good rich classic color. It was great color for her too.","I would not normally say a bird print would be a good idea, but I loved Zendaya in Dolce & Gabbana's off the shoulder, full trained dress was gorgeous!","",""

A lot of times clothes don't even match anymore and everyone still seems to love it.","I do see that a lot. They wear colors like orange and purple and everyone thinks that it looks good.","I think that mismatched colors can look good, but sometimes people get a little carried away with the combinations.","I've noticed that a lot of the stars like to really follow the newest fashion trends.","I've noticed that too. They wear this stuff even if it does not look good on them.","Then again, sometimes the stars start the fashion trends.","Especially like the Kardashians. They seem to always be starting some new trend.","Yeah, like the trend with the clear boots.","Those things looked so uncomfortable. I dont understand why anyone would want to wear them.","I guess we can both agree that a lot of the new fashion trends are a little crazy and uncomfortable.","I think it would be the fact that everyone is wearing knitted and tight fitting clothing.","Yes they are, and still people love to wear these things.","Really? I thought for sure it was all the bright stripes and colors that everyone seems to be wearing.","You know, that is a really good one too. I think there are a few new fashion trends this year.","A lot of girls are also wearing their bras out now.","Yeah, that is true. Though I'm not sure I am a big fan of that trend.","Personally, I will always be a big fan of the florals. They always seem to come back.","Yes! Florals reminds me of the 80's trend that is slowly coming back.","You're right. It seems more and more that people are dressing like they used to in the 80's and 90's.","",""
