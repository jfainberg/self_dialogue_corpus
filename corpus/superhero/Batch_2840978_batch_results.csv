I recently saw the new movie Logan.","What did you think about the movie Logan?","I thought it was refreshing to see the character of Wolverine depicted without a strong supporting cast of X-Men.  I think Wolverine's personality is quite unique among heroes and deserves solo endeavors.","Did you like the new female character that was Logan's biological offspring?","I liked her somewhat, because she shares some of the same personality traits as Wolverine.","You keep mentioning Wolverine's personality.  Could you elaborate on that?","Well, Wolverine is a very wild, almost uncontrollable person.  But, he usually has moments where he can control himself and make strong positive contributions to himself, his team, and the world in general.","I see.  So you like that he could be perceived as a type of ""wild card."""
