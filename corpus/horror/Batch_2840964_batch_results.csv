Prom Night, Terror Train, the Halloween Series, The Fog, there's so many and she just has so much charisma on screen playing these types of roles.","I'm trying to think of some modern scream queens, and the only name that comes to mind for me of late is Mary Elizabeth Winstead for all the movies she's done so far in horror.","She's definitely my favorite right now! I think she needs to do more because she's so good in horror roles. Final Destination 3, The Thing, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Black Christmas, she just plays the character so well!","Those are some nostalgic movies. She really shined in Final Destination 3 and The Thing.
