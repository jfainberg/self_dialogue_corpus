I really like Jonny Greenwood's film music as well.","But if you are not a fan of the singing then they are never going to be a band that you love.","x",""

When you listen to people from her time sing they sound sort of classical.","Classical? What do you mean?","Their voices have vibrato and they're rich and mellow sounding.

Legit singing is singing in that older, smoother, more classical style.

Listen to The Sound of Music and then listen to Legally Blonde.  You'll hear the difference right away.","Yeah.

It has a fantastic beat and I love the flow.","Do you think dubstep has died out?","I don't think it's died out entirely. I think it's moreso become more integrated into other genres of music like pop and rock.","You mean like a lot of club music has sirens and similar noises?","Yeah, but also in that a lot of pop musicians have collaborated with dubstep artists like Skrillex.","What's your opinion of Skrillex?","I think his music's alright. I think he's a bit overrated in the dubstep world, but that's probably because he was the one who made the cornerstone in the genre.","Dubstep reminds me a lot of freestyle street music that they made in the 90s a lot.

That shows what a great fan you are.  What are some of your other favorite albums that he did?","I always liked ""Don't Shoot me, i'm the piano player,"" and i really liked ""the fox,"" which was recorded a bit later, i think in 1980.","""the Fox?""  I""m not familiar with that one.","Well it's not one of his most famous albums; it has quite a mellow sound to most of it's songs.  I especially like ""Chloe"" which was not a big hit but which remains one of my favorite Elton John songs.","Didn't Elton go through a bit of a ""slump"" at one point when his popularity took a bit of a dive?","You're probably referring to the mid to late 1980s.  but when he worked on the ""Lion King"" soundtrack, that slump was a thing of the past.  His contribution to that soundtrack brought him hundreds of thousands of new fans who saw how versatile he was.,","Do you remember his song ""Friends?""  That wasn't a big hit but i consider it one of his best.","Actually I do remember it.  there is actually a ""Friends"" soundtrack which i remember giving to my wife as a gift many years ago.","I never knew it was a soundtrack.  But i do own the single; on vinyl of course.  It was his follow up to ""Your Song.""","One thing people may forget is that he had a serious drug problem early in his career; but thank goodness he came through it.","I would say i'm one of the biggest Elton John fans around.  i think he's great.","Now that you mention it, i remember him talking about the drug problem during an interview.  you're right, it's very fortunate that he came through it.  nice talking to you about this living legend.","Me too.  i've been a fan of his for almost fifty years, since ""Your Song"" hit the charts.","Me too, and that remains one of my favorite of his songs.  It's a beautiful song with great lyrics.","One of the great things about Elton is that he has done so many great ballads, but so many up-tempo songs as well.","Definitely.  For example, he did ""Satuday Night's all right for Fighting,"" and also ""Candle in the Wind,"" and both are on the same album.","Yes, his classic ""goodbye yellow brick road"" album had those songs and so many other great tunes.","I think of all his albums, that one sold the most.  Almost all my friends at that time bought that album as soon as it came out.","I actually remember the day i bought that album.  I got it at the college bookstore, all those years ago when i was a student.","x",""
