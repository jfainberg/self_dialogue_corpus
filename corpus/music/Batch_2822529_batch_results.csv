For a while, after he left Yes, he played with King Crimson.","What do his solo albums sound like?","It sounds mostly like jazz, but the instrumentation and structure is somewhat rock influenced. It seems he is primarily a Jazz artist.","I haven't gotten into jazz-rock fusion very much, but I do like jazz and progressive rock in general.","If that's the case you should definitely give Bill Bruford a try. My favorite song of his is ""One of a Kind"" of the same titled album.","You mean the band named Yes? Yes, I do.","Good suggestion. Next time I'm on Spotify I'll give it a go.","For many years in my childhood they were my favorite band, and pretty much the only music I ever listened to.","I was a big fan of them also during their hayday. I've often wondered what other bands were in the same league with their creativity and ability.","I think if you are a Yes fan, you should check out some of the solo albums and other spinoff albums that were done by the members of the group.","Is that so? I wasn't aware of those works.","In particular, the solo albums by Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Chris Squire are very good.","Really? Which ones would you recommend?","Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth is well known, and he did an album called No Earthly Connection, which is really terrific.","",""

That coupled with the musical talent is intriguing.","Her virtuoso ability on the piano is really stunning - I would say even enough that you completely forget she's a cute girl.","Does she play with any jazz musicians I've heard of?","Yes. She has recorded albums with Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke to name a couple.","What is Hiromi?","That's pretty impressive.","Hiromi is a She. Her name is Hiromi Uehara.","Is she Japanese?","Yes. She's a Japanese jazz pianist.","That's interesting. I like jazz, but I never associated that genre with Japan.","I don't think there are any other prominent Japanese jazz artists, at least not known in the United States.","Is she very new on the scene?","She has been performing for quite a while.

The term ""Salsa"" started in New York and one of the most representative artists for this music genre was a group called ""Fania All Stars"".","Yes, there is a bunch of Latin music genres: Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, Vallenato.

In fact, progressive rock has a very obvious influence from jazz that you can hear in the music at times.","Which bands do you think really epitomize this kind of music?","I think some of the less mainstream bands are more progressive sounding. Bands like Gentle Giant, King Crimson and Yes are much more complex and experimental sounding.","Which albums do you think are good examples of this.","Well, if you like Pink Floyd, you will find that some of their earlier albums, before Dark Side of the Moon, are much more experimental. A good example is Ummagumma.","That's a weird name. It sounds like something a caveman would say.","In general, I would say the late 60s and early 70s is a time of experimentation and you will hear albums with some really weird stuff going on.","What else do you think characterizes this music style?","Well, in the mid 70s I think these bands became more serious and started releasing albums with long tracks that were up to 20 minutes long. Rock was transforming into a fine art genre, but people began to lose interest and sales dropped.","What is progressive rock?","That's always the case. When an artform progresses to a more sophistocated level, it takes more specialized people to appreciate it.","You might be familiar with it from bands like Yes, Rush and Pink Floyd.","I'm definitely familiar with Pink Floyd, but haven't listened to Rush or Yes, although I've heard of them. What makes the music so ""progressive""?","I think the term is used because some bands from the 60s and 70s experimented with a lot of styles and sounds to try and create very unique music. Progressive music is also characterized by a high degree of musical prowess.","What kind of musical prowess do you mean? That's kind of vague.","You're right. In the case of progressive rock, it has more to do with the instrumental parts and the highly-developed abilities of the performers.","You mean they can play a lot of notes, basically?","There's the technical ability, and it's also the willingness to expand the chord structure and use different time signatures and rhythms.","",""

It's a perfectly short 40-minute suite of seduction pop.","Don't get me wrong, I love In Rainbows, it's easily one of Radiohead's best. But it's not as revolutionary as Kid A or OK Computer.","I definitely agree with the Kid A part. You'd be hard-pressed to find a band completely reinventing themselves like that in a more dynamic way.","Listening to it still gives me chills. How they could come up with a song as unsettling as Idioteque is beyond me.","Agreed. It's one of their most unique songs, and luckily they always play it live in their setlist. Did you know I saw their set at Lollapalooza last year?","Really? That's amazing, I've always wanted to see them live. They hardly ever tour though.","I'm telling you, it was the most surreal, wonderful and amazing concert I've ever been to. It was almost a spiritual experience, it was that good.","I don't doubt it, each one of the band members are consistently at the top of their game, and have the precision of classically trained musicians.","Yeah, and they did not disappoint in the slightest. I hope I get to see them again in my lifetime before they call it quits.","I love it, but the breakdown in the middle of the song with the flute comes off as pretentious to me.","If you do, take me with you!","Yes, I agree. However, it's still a great song and seems very vital considering the state of the world right now.","Yeah, I have no doubt the album will be fantastic. Did you hear that Radiohead are releasing the 20th Anniversary Edition of OK Computer soon?","I did hear that, yes. The super-deluxe edition vinyl is something I desperately want to purchase, but it is hard to justify the $130 price tag.","I think it'll definitely be worth the money, considering how much bonus content comes with it. It's a wonderful collector's item, and it's only fitting to buy it since I think it's one of the best albums of all time.","I'm tempted to agree with you, but I will always think In Rainbows is a tighter, more consistently perfect collection of songs. I think OK Computer has one or two filler tracks, like Climbing Up The Walls and Lucky.","No way, Lucky is one of the hidden gems on OK Computer. You always hear praise about Paranoid Android and Subterranean Homesick Alien instead.","That's a good point, but it still feels slightly bloated to me. It's also a very heavy listen and can be incredibly depressing depending on what mood you're in.","",""
