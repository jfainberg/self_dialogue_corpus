What about Bill Bruford?","Bill Bruford is definitely one of the greatest drummers to ever play in a rock band. He created some great jazz-rock fusion albums, although it bares no resemblance to the Yes sound.","He was also the drummer for King Crimson, wasn't he?","Yes. For a while, after he left Yes, he played with King Crimson.","What do his solo albums sound like?","It sounds mostly like jazz, but the instrumentation and structure is somewhat rock influenced. It seems he is primarily a Jazz artist.","I haven't gotten into jazz-rock fusion very much, but I do like jazz and progressive rock in general.","If that's the case you should definitely give Bill Bruford a try. My favorite song of his is ""One of a Kind"" of the same titled album.","You mean the band named Yes? Yes, I do.","Good suggestion. Next time I'm on Spotify I'll give it a go.","For many years in my childhood they were my favorite band, and pretty much the only music I ever listened to.","I was a big fan of them also during their hayday. I've often wondered what other bands were in the same league with their creativity and ability.","I think if you are a Yes fan, you should check out some of the solo albums and other spinoff albums that were done by the members of the group.","Is that so? I wasn't aware of those works.","In particular, the solo albums by Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Chris Squire are very good.","Really? Which ones would you recommend?","Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth is well known, and he did an album called No Earthly Connection, which is really terrific."

I would say this is mostly because of the jazz influence.","That's true.

I like that style of music but I rarely listen to it. You don't hear it on the radio very much.","King Crimson, in particular, is not played on the radio nearly as much as Yes and of course not as much as Pink Floyd.","Yeah. Pink Floyd is a constant thing on classic rock stations. They're really great though.","I think King Crimson, in terms of artistic merit, is every bit as good as Pink Floyd, if not better.","Really?

She's a Japanese jazz pianist.","That's interesting.

In fact, progressive rock has a very obvious influence from jazz that you can hear in the music at times.","Which bands do you think really epitomize this kind of music?","I think some of the less mainstream bands are more progressive sounding. Bands like Gentle Giant, King Crimson and Yes are much more complex and experimental sounding.","Which albums do you think are good examples of this.","Well, if you like Pink Floyd, you will find that some of their earlier albums, before Dark Side of the Moon, are much more experimental. A good example is Ummagumma.","That's a weird name. It sounds like something a caveman would say.","In general, I would say the late 60s and early 70s is a time of experimentation and you will hear albums with some really weird stuff going on.","What else do you think characterizes this music style?","Well, in the mid 70s I think these bands became more serious and started releasing albums with long tracks that were up to 20 minutes long. Rock was transforming into a fine art genre, but people began to lose interest and sales dropped.","What is progressive rock?","That's always the case. When an artform progresses to a more sophistocated level, it takes more specialized people to appreciate it.","You might be familiar with it from bands like Yes, Rush and Pink Floyd.","I'm definitely familiar with Pink Floyd, but haven't listened to Rush or Yes, although I've heard of them. What makes the music so ""progressive""?","I think the term is used because some bands from the 60s and 70s experimented with a lot of styles and sounds to try and create very unique music. Progressive music is also characterized by a high degree of musical prowess.","What kind of musical prowess do you mean? That's kind of vague.","You're right. In the case of progressive rock, it has more to do with the instrumental parts and the highly-developed abilities of the performers.","You mean they can play a lot of notes, basically?","There's the technical ability, and it's also the willingness to expand the chord structure and use different time signatures and rhythms."

Is it really good?","I think they're very unique and creative. They write songs with good lyrics and an interesting sound which definitely sounds European.","I'm always looking for something different, so I sometimes check out European groups. Are they really new?","Actually, they've been around since the late '90s.","I see. It's funny that I haven't heard of them. They must be obscure.","They never had any really big hits here in the United States, but one of their songs was used on a Geico commercial. You would definitely recognize it if you heard it."

However, there is a lot of overlap between artists who were ""outlaw,"" or outside of the Nashville music scene and red dirt artists.","What is the sound like?","Red dirt sounds more like bluegrass, rock, Western swing, honky tonk, even Mexican influences. I think most of the country music coming out of Nashville has undeniable pop overtones.","When did this begin?","It began in the 1970s, and really grew to apex around the early 2000s. However, many people today would say that the gap in the types of music are closing.","If they don't go to Nashville, how to these artists get their start?","The musicians tour various honky tonks, dance halls, fraternity parties, wherever they can get a gig.","I don't know what that is. What kind of country is it?","That sounds so good and interesting! I will certainly check it out!","It's a type of country music that comes out of Texas and Oklahoma.","That sounds interesting, why is it different than regular country?","It is specially non-Nashville, and it embraces the down home roots of country music. It doesn't really have any pop elements in it.","Why did it begin?","Red Dirt began because of a distaste for Nashville country, and because certain country artists felt they were being shut out of the Nashville music scene. A lot of the songs in red dirt reflect that sentiment.","So do all of the bands and musicians come from Texas or Oklahoma?","I think originally, yes, but today many artists do not."

It's a perfectly short 40-minute suite of seduction pop.","Don't get me wrong, I love In Rainbows, it's easily one of Radiohead's best. But it's not as revolutionary as Kid A or OK Computer.","I definitely agree with the Kid A part. You'd be hard-pressed to find a band completely reinventing themselves like that in a more dynamic way.","Listening to it still gives me chills. How they could come up with a song as unsettling as Idioteque is beyond me.","Agreed. It's one of their most unique songs, and luckily they always play it live in their setlist. Did you know I saw their set at Lollapalooza last year?","Really? That's amazing, I've always wanted to see them live. They hardly ever tour though.","I'm telling you, it was the most surreal, wonderful and amazing concert I've ever been to. It was almost a spiritual experience, it was that good.","I don't doubt it, each one of the band members are consistently at the top of their game, and have the precision of classically trained musicians.","Yeah, and they did not disappoint in the slightest. I hope I get to see them again in my lifetime before they call it quits.","I love it, but the breakdown in the middle of the song with the flute comes off as pretentious to me.","If you do, take me with you!","Yes, I agree. However, it's still a great song and seems very vital considering the state of the world right now.","Yeah, I have no doubt the album will be fantastic. Did you hear that Radiohead are releasing the 20th Anniversary Edition of OK Computer soon?","I did hear that, yes. The super-deluxe edition vinyl is something I desperately want to purchase, but it is hard to justify the $130 price tag.","I think it'll definitely be worth the money, considering how much bonus content comes with it. It's a wonderful collector's item, and it's only fitting to buy it since I think it's one of the best albums of all time.","I'm tempted to agree with you, but I will always think In Rainbows is a tighter, more consistently perfect collection of songs. I think OK Computer has one or two filler tracks, like Climbing Up The Walls and Lucky.","No way, Lucky is one of the hidden gems on OK Computer. You always hear praise about Paranoid Android and Subterranean Homesick Alien instead.","That's a good point, but it still feels slightly bloated to me.

I would say they're similar to Radio Head.","The vocalist is similar to Radio Head's. The instrumentals, in my opinion, can get more similar to heavy metal at times than Radio Head.","I think I heard something about that. Tool is great.","That's true.","Yes they are.","Do you know what other bands sound like them?","Well, if you like Tool, you should probably try listening to A Perfect Circle.","I think I've heard them.

How would you compare A Perfect Circle to Tool?","Their sound is not quite as loud and heavy as Tool, but I think the rhythm and melodies are almost identical in character."

I bet there are some things you might like if you know the right stuff to listen to.","Yeah? like what?","Well, if you like the Star Wars music, you might want to try listenign to ""The Planets"" by Gustav Holst.

So does it sound like a movie?","Yes, at times when listening to the piece it feels like you could be watching a space epic like Star Wars.","Why is it called ""The Planets""?","The piece is comprised of several sections, called movements, that each musically describe the planets in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Mars.","How does music describe a planet?","Well, as you probably know, the planets were named after greek gods. For example, Mars was the god of war, so the Mars movement sounds like the kind of music in a movie about ancient battles.","What do you mean by composer? Do you mean songwriter?","That's cool. I'm curious enough to maybe try listening to it.","No. A composer is someone who writes music, such as symphonies or cinematic film scores.","Oh.
