I hadn't heard about them until The Singles Club and then the album, Paramore, came out, so I didn't know they'd gone through a couple rotations of band members.","I really didn't see Davis leaving the band again. It seems like there's an explosion in the band, they regroup, remember that they love what they're doing and they want to keep at it, and then they put out a new album. You have to figure that the sound and vibe of each is going to be a bit different just based on that alone.","I think all bands that stick together for the long haul end up having some progression in their music and vibe. Unless they decide to stick with what works in the band and then do their own solo thing to explore anything else.","I think so too. I know that the Farro brothers were supposed to be leaving in order to pursue another band but I'm not sure whether Taylor York or Jeremy Davis have done their own things. Hayley has down a few solo things but it's usually a feature for another artist.","I remember her being featured in that B.o.B song, Airplanes. A couple of others, too.","It'll be interesting to see what happens after they've toured for this album. They've been a constant for me since 2006 so of course I'd hate to not see another album from them but I also hate that there seems to be so many problems.","I feel like there's always a fair amount of songs with each album that concern whatever the drama was. At least with the self titled album and this one, anyways.","Yep, there was some pretty pointed shade on the self titled album. I guess that's why everyone was so shocked that Zac came back; it's hard to believe that Jeremy leaving was even more contentious and tense than the brothers leaving.","Still, they've made really catchy songs that stick with you. I mean, they've got talent and Hayley is a great singer so you have to think that she'll probably stick with it no matter what.","They re very catchy. I'm not sure if I've fallen for any of these songs as hard as I fell for Native Tongue or Still Into You off of 2013's album, Hard Times has been the catchiest for me so far.","I haven't had a chance to listen to the whole album but I've heard a few songs.","I think I'll probably go back and listen to their old stuff just so I know what people are talking about concerning the change. I vaguely remember hearing one or two of those songs, maybe seeing the music videos.","A lot of people say it's completely different from their other stuff. Do you like what you've heard so far?","I really liked the first song they posted on their Facebook, Hard Times. I'm still not too sure whether I love Told You So or not.","I think Hard Times was definitely different than what I was expecting, especially with Zac Farro rejoining the band. I do like it better than Told You So but I love the reasoning Hayley Williams gave for the song.","I haven't seen any interviews about Told You So, what did she say about it?","The gist of a few articles was that, because they've been so unsure of whether there would even be a new album after Jeremy Davis left, she always has this feeling that everyone around her can see the warning signs even though she can't. So everyone's waiting around to say they told her so when things go badly.","I can see that. I got that it was about people assuming they were right and saying they told you so but I didn't really think about it in relation to the band.","I do think the sound is different compared to their other albums but I think that's one of the things I love about the band, really.","",""

Their first three albums are overly cerebral: too many self-aware lyrics, and too simplistic a musical style.","Actually, I think that's why Brian Eno picked both Bowie and the Talking Heads to produce: a simple musical style.","That's a good point.  Eno liked to find a groove and build on it; it seems that a simple style would be more attractive to him.","So -- between David Bowie and the Talking Heads, who would you choose?","I would go with the Talking Heads: I think that both their lyrical and musical style had more development over the course of their career.","Wouldn't you agree, though, that Bowie's lyrics were more relevant to his audience throughout the years?","That's a good point: he made alienation into a virtue, and yet always retained a strong sense of irony. Look at his last single: 'Lazarus'.","Knowing what we know now -- that he was that close to death -- it must have taken some courage to address it head on like that.","Musical courage -- I think that that really sums up David Bowie.  He never held back!","Oh -- Bowie was great!  He really could play all sorts of music.","And that is, I think, why I would have to choose David Bowie over Talking Heads.  They were both really good, though.","Do you like him better than Talking Heads?","Well, I can't really say that.  I like the way Talking Heads incorporated all sorts of world music touches into their music.","They both used Brian Eno as a producer at different times in their career. What do you think of him?","Eno is kind of abstract.  Talking Heads and David Bowie made more accessible music, in my opinion.","So. if you had to decide between them, which one would you pick?","I find Bowie easier to dance to.

Some of it was on the surface, like I'm not Angry and Blame it on Cain, some of it was just this enormous mass of seething anger under the surface, like Watching the Detectives and I'm Not Angry.","So anger changed your life?","Well, in a way it did. It gave me focus for my dissatisfaction, and pulled me out of my general malaise.","Yes, I guess I can see that, for you. You still have that anger, as well as a continual rebalancing of anger and malaise.What's your favorite song from the album.","That's hard. I love so many of them. I think it would be easier to name the ones I am a little bit less than crazy about.","Okay, what are they?","I feel like No Dancing and Mystery Dance just fall a little bit below the level of the rest of the album. But that's okay. No one can hit a homerun every time they are up.","You didn't ask, but my favorite on the album is Alison. I could listen to it ten times in a row.","I love that song, too.His sadness and regret are palpable. And his feeling of having been cheated to the utmost.","Yes, I feel like it is almost a match for Good Year for the Roses.","I bet I have quite a few. First one that comes to mind is My Aim is True.","Oh, good point. I love that song, too.","Elvis Costello, right? I'm sort of surprised.","I still remember the first time I heard it. I had a restaurant job the summer between high school and college. I wasn't happy with it. Just dragged myself there every night.","So, go on.","One night I stopped by Marilyn's house before work because she had a new album she wanted me to hear, and it was My Aim is True.","When did that come out? Like '77, '78?","It was '77, at least in the States. Summer of '77.","So what was it about the album?","",""

I would contact the seller about this.","that's exactly what i'm going to do because this whole thing is messed up.  but thanks for explaining to me how there were different versions of Beatles albums.","DId you realize you just made a pun?  you said ""help"", their second movie.","no problem.  and i didn't even mention that Capital has ""reissued"" many of their albums that had been previously available only on vinyl.  we'll deal with that another time.  take care!","Hah! No I didn't even know i made the pun, but it's not a bad one.  anyway, i have a question about a Beatles CD that i received yesterday.","there you go again with the pun, saying ""yesterday,"" perhaps Paul McCartney's most famous song.  but seriously, what's your question?","I'm completely confused.  I received the CD, ""a hard day's night; soundtrack"", which i had ordered from amazon.","great movie; i've seen it maybe eight times.  so how's the CD?","Well, i received the United Artists album, and now i understand there is a Capital records version.  Also, i am now told there is an England version, and a United States version.  what the heck! please explain this to me.","I don't blame you for being confused, because there have been a few re-releases of the original 1964 album, which was the United Artists album.  I'm referring to the album released here in the States.","But what about the ""a hard day's night"" album that was released in England?","",""
