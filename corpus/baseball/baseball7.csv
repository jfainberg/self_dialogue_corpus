I got so i could field and throw well in the infield,","Well that's a good feeling I liked to throw too and had a pretty good arm. I could throw home from the wall if need be.","I guess the regular first baseman didn't like any competition.  He had about 50 pounds on me and during infield practice he was up and hit to third.  I stretched towards third to try to catch it and get him out and he instead ran right into my left side full steam rather than the base.","Ouch, that must have hurt.

Another that did well for the team but was filled with controversial issues is A Rod.  Great player, huge salary big home runs but failed to live up to his potential.","Sure he got caught up in the illegal substance scandals which will mar his legacy.","He did some class things too like when he was in the All star game early in his career playing short and Cal Ripken Jr. was in his last All Star game on third. You recall that.","I sure do he asked Ripken to switch with him as he felt that Ripken was the most awesome shortstop and should play his spot in that game.","Yeah he was a spark plug middle infielder who was traded just as Derek Jeter started to play.","That was a real classy move but the other scandals might delay his getting in the hall of fame for a while.

He was very friendly and autographed a picture for my young daughter which was a thrill for her.  It would have been nice if he could have made a career there.","Well, he was replaced by Jeter who turned out to be one of the greatest of all time.  Dang what an awesome guy.","Sure thing a steady consistent player who batted over .300 average with over 3,000 hits hall of fame for sure, 20 seasons.","The nice thing was that he was such a positive role model with no whining and all about his team and doing his best for the fans.","Yep, he earned the title of Captain and did a great job as Yankee Captain for years.
