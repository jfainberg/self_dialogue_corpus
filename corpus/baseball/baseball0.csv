I kind of wish I had, now.","This pitcher isn't doing so well. He's walked everyone so far.","I don't know if I trust this ump's calls.","The Twins will probably get a run by getting walked in.","See that one? That was clearly a strike. The ump didn't call it.","Eh, it was little out of bounds. Maybe.","You're probably right. Ugh! The Orioles just get cocky. And then they lose.","One run for the Twins! Can't believe they walked a guy in.","No, I'm actually more of an Orioles fan.","Typical.","I didn't know that! What inning is this?","Looks like the top of the third.","Orioles are killing it -- six runs already.","They usually do well at the beginning and then flunk at the end.","Well, the Twins have been terrible this year.","Have you gone to many games this year?","Only two. I've been too busy. What about you?"

Thats easy. I would prove to them he deserves it.","And how would you do that?"
