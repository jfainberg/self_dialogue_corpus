What exactly is baseball?","Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means.","You mention a pitcher. What are all of the positions played in baseball?","Pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.","How long does the game last?","A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.","I'm anxious to know where this sport came from? Do you know where it was first played?","In the 18th century in England.","You know so much about baseball. How do you know so much?","I played softball when I was younger.  I like to watch baseball also in my free time and have researched a lot about the sport.","It was so nice talking to you about baseball and I thank you very much!  I really learned a lot.","It is a ball game between two teams of nine on a field with a diamond-shaped circuit of four bases.","You are welcome. I enjoyed talking about this sport I enjoy.","It sounds fun and competitive.  Where is it played?","It is played in the US, Canada, Latin America, and East Asia.","What are the bases called?","First, second, third, and home plate.","What happens during baseball?","The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.","It seems there is a lot going on with this sport.  Can you tell me more about it?"

They were pretty rowdy there.","I don't remember seeing many scraps at the minor league park.  It was close a couple times and both benches cleared but the umps got it under control in time.","I don't remember seeing any fights at the Yankee games.  Just in the parking lot when everyone tried to leave at the same time.","They had special days at the park too, they gave away things like small bats, team balls, caps and the like.  Every week there was something else to draw the fans to the park.","I did not go to that many Yankee games.  I think it was about ten over a few years.  I do not remember if they had gimmicks.  Maybe some little trinkets.","It was so fun to go to the games. There were sights, sounds and smells that were at no other place and i will always remember them.","I went to mostly Yankees games.  Like I saw that one armed pitcher Jim Abbott pitch a no hitter for 8 innings until it was broken up by a hit by Bo Jackson of the White Sox.","For sure.  If you got there at the right time they would let you go to the monument park and look at the bronze plaques  That was pretty cool too.  Nothing like going to the old ball game!","Cool. It must have been nice to be in that park.  I liked the minor league games as they were much cheaper to attend and sometimes big stars would play in rehab games or appear.","It does cost to go to the show.  That game I saw a Yankee steal home successfully.  Almost couldn't believe what i was looking at.","Reggie Jackson came to the minor league park as an attraction after he retired and put on a home run show.  He must have hit the ball about 500 feet about 15 times in towering drives.  That was cool.","Neat.  A few weeks after the Abbott game they played the Indians and that time he made a no hitter.  That was awesome.  What a thrill to see such a special game.","I bet.  The minor league games I attended were very fast paced and the players seemed to go full tilt for the whole game.  What some of them lacked in talent they made up for wit hustle and guts.","I was lucky in that we scored tickets from a well connected friend.  It lasted for a few years and all I needed to do was pay for food and the seats were great.","The minor league games were fun.  I remember there were a group of people in the upper deck that always wore aviators goggles and hats."

Before then they had the old Negro leagues and had many awesome players that never came to the majore","Sometimes they would play the majors in exhibition games.  The Negro League teams usually did very well in them.","Many great players never played in the majors due to the color barrier and racism.  It was nice that the Hall of Fame devoted a wing to the old Negro Leagues and some of the great players from that era.","Who was the last batter to hit over .400?

He had a high average for his lifetime too,","Yeah, he homered in his last at bat at age 42.  He sure went out with a bang and hit about .320 even at that age.","He was a remarkable player who went his own way.  Spent 5 years in the military in two wars.  Fighter pilot.  I guess he was a real life Superman if there ever was one!","Sure thing, its impossible to say who the greatest player ever is.  He would certainly be one of them.","Baseball has a remarkable history and surely was/is a national pastime.  It's hard to figure the salaries.  Now big stars get over 20 million a season with many perks.","Sure, guys like Mickey Mantle, for example made about 100,000 per year tops.  Even though it was years ago it is just hard to figure out.  Were the owners making that much back then?","Cool.  I read about many of those guys and remember seeing quite a few grainy films of them playing.","That's a complicated issue.  I just liked seeing guys like Ty Cobb sliding hard into base.  Most of the players today aren't so aggressive.  Don't want to get hurt.  The old timers sure were a tough group.","Back then in the early twentieth century If you hit 10 home runs that was awesome.  They seemed to play more for strategy and stealing bases.","Plus the ball was not lively like today.  The ball was wrapped much looser and could not travel as far when hit.","It didn't fly off of the end of the bat like they do now, to hit it over the fence took incredible power and many homers were inside the park ones.","Those guys could really run and hit, there were higher batting averages then too.  They really played as a team to win, double steals, hit and run, bunting.","Then the Bambino came and tore up the league with his power hitting and he was an awesome pitcher as well.  Quite a sensation he was.","Yeah, Boston was mad that he was sold to the Yankees.  Around then the ball was wrapped tighter and began to fly off of the bat.","Sure, the owners realized that fans liked the home runs and they wanted to please to get more fans in the seats.  Then the money came rolling in."

I think Mickey Mantle was the only other switch hitter as good as him.","Who were the other Braves players that you read about that were recently elected to the hall of fame?","They were John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux.","Didn't they all pitch for the Braves at the same time?","They sure did, and they even won a World Series championship.","Did Chipper play with them?","He did, and his rookie season, 1995, was the year they won the World Series.","Who was their manager that year?","Yes, and they have had several men become elected into the hall of fame recently.","Bobby Cox, who, by the way, is also in the hall of fame.","That's incredible, considering the hall of fame is pretty exclusive.","I bet Braves fans miss those days when they all played.","I'm sure they do, but they certainly can rebound to that point.","I read about a guy named Chipper Jones, and he was really good, but why isn't he in the hall of fame?","Well, he isn't eligible yet, but next year he will be.","Do you think he will get elected to the hall of fame?","I'm sure he will because he played great defense at third base and hit very well."
