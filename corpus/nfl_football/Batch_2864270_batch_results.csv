I think DeVante Parker would be my pick.","He is definitely up there. What's your reason?","Parker was one of Miami's best players in spring practices, and was hard to defend and made various big plays.","x",""

Who do you think emerges as the slot receiver between Dede Westbrook and Marqise Lee?","That is a great question. They both remind me of each other. I know that the two Allens in Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns will be the outside receivers, but between Marqise and Dede, I am not certain. I think that Dede has the potential to blow the top off of defenses where Marqise Lee is more of the medium, diagonal route running man who may not get the yards after the catch. I think that Jacksonville is in a weird place because they drafted a RB yet they have many WR to share the ball with, I don't know, I think a four receiver set puts them in an awkward position.","Absolutely. I wish the best for Fournette, but I don't think that he will earn his wage or that he will even meet the expectations that people have of him.","Speaking of awkward and weird, Bortles is best in shotgun where Fournette is best running out of the backfield with a fullback or in an ace formation with the QB under center. What does the offensive coordinator do to get the most out of both players?","I think it has to be situational, and this isn't even referring to Bortles or Fournette, but you go gun when you're down or time is low before half and you otherwise go under center and pound the rock as much as you can with Fournette. I would like to see Fournette get 25 or more carries per game.","I would be really impressed if her were to get that many touches, and I mean from carries and receptions.","That is a tough workload for a rookie RB, especially in today's NFL.","If he is getting that many carries, then that can only mean good things for Jacksonville.","Duuuuuvaaaaaall! As my friends in northern Florida would say.","I think Jacksonville will surprise a lot of teams.","Duuuuuuuuuuvvvvaaaaaalll! hahaha It has to be long drawn out and proud. They will be my ""second team"" this season as I do think and hope they hold their own in an emerging division.","Why do you say so?","I think that they already had a great offense, and now that they have signed AJ Bouye and Calais Campbell, it only makes sense for them to get even better. I anticipate they will have a top 3 defense.","I do see them being a great team if and only if that offense, primarily Bortles, can pull back his 2015 form.","Definitely. He wasn't even an efficient QB though that season, that was more him just being a Favre-like gunslinger. I do think that the offense is held to a mid-level ceiling.","What would hold them back, or rather, what do they have to do to overcome repeating basically the Jacksonville side of the last decade?","It all goes back to Bortles and who is going to play RG and TE on the offense as well.","My big concern if I were a Jags fan is that the AFC South though is getting much, much better and I just have my doubts that Jacksonville can overcome Tennessee or Indy, and even Houston.","x",""

We did sign a guy, Jake Eldrenkamp that we apparently loved and were willing to draft. He's our backup center competing with Austin Blythe who we signed off waivers from the Colts.","Imagine if you took Dan Marino and put him (with all the modern conditioning and sports science) in charge of a modern spread offense. How much better he be?","Put Cam Newton on a team from 40-50 years ago and you have unparalleled domination.","Put Cam on the Air Coryell Chargers with people like Alworth Winslow and Joiner. You have a qb who can move like crazy and has an amazing pass offense.","Alternatively, put him on a Wing or T or whatever offense of the 30s-50s. Although the culture wouldnt be positive, his athleticism would wreck defenses","You think he gets vilified now, imagine 50 years ago as the first black quarterback","He wouldn't be vilified... He would be a sports legend.","The first black qb threw for 5122 yards in college earning the right to be drafted in the 14th round to play cornerback.","he had to negotiate his own contract with the Broncos to say he must have a three day trial at qb so he could use the public and press attention at the camp to his advantage. He managed to get the job because there was no one else.","I'd say the same of Vick as well, if not more so. Newton is harder to bring down, but Vick had an elusiveness that made him a 1000+ yard rusher even in the current era.","Todd Gurleys 2016 stats pale in comparison to what he did in his rookie season.","Jesus, Vick in that era would be like Bo Jackson in Tecmo Bowl!","I've heard rams fans claim this was either because opposing defenses stacked the box in the face of an anemic rams passing attack, or because gurley's actual play got worse.","RT Rob Havenstein regressed due to an ankle injury. Center Tim Barnes went from inconsistent to just bad. We lost Garrett Reynolds who was actually a really good run blocker. Jamon Brown/Cody Wichmann/Andrew Donnal all were poor guards. It got worse for sure.","And also, it did suck in 2015 too. Aside from Gurley's hot start in his first 4 or so, he really didn't do a whole ton the rest of that year either. Mostly just the occasional big play that we didn't get this year.","How do you think he'll do this year? Have they made any changes to the Oline?","Kromer is a fantastic OL coach. Aside from beating 14 year olds up, they were lucky to get him. He turned our OL into what it is right now.","he wasn't much of a coordinator but gave the bears the best O line they've had in my lifetime.","That's gotta be the oddest collection of aging vets and young talent. Did they draft any depth to develop at C or OT?","x",""

In the 1990s we had a shot to stop the cowboys and their dynasty in the 96 superbowl.","Yes, you also had a shot to stop John Elway and Denver in the late 1990s.","We are 6-2 in super bowls and unfortunately, the Patriots have passed the Steelers with most super bowl appearances.","x",""

You also have guys returning from injuries that were experienced early on, you always see that. Plus, the age old football motto of ""next man up"" will be more important than ever.","If it was any longer I think teams would need two byes.","They should already get on that. Give each team 2 byes, have them spaced out between weeks 3 and 15. That way they have football on more weeks in the year and slightly fewer games per week so smaller market teams don't lose as much viewership to big games.","3-4 game expansion wouldn't require an additional bye, in my opinion of course.

Being in limbo between bust and not bust status is much like Schrodinger's cat.

I mean, you can't choose to be one or the other.

With Carr, Lynch and Del Rio, things will be interesting, provided Carr's injury doesn't linger.","How about the Rams? Can they improve?","They have a desirable attendance problem: they have too many fans coming to the games.

But as a football team they have little to offer.","How will the Chargers fare in their new digs?","The small stadium might be a useful experiment for the NFL, but I think the Chargers still have an identity crisis. Some players are unhappy with the move from San Diego, and what looms after the small stadium experience is playing second fiddle to the Rams.

If Prescott stalls and Elliott is disciplined, then what?","Can the Falcons repeat their success of a year ago?","Unlikely. Losing the biggest game of all the way they did will hurt, and the new stadium will be a distraction, not a boost.","Who is a sleeper contender?","The New England Patriots will continue to be favorites so long as Tom Brady is under center and Bill Belichick is on the sidelines.","The Washington Redskins. They keep inching forward out of the morass that Daniel Snyder mired them in.","The Pats should be glad to finally have the Commissioner off their backs, eh?","I think being rid of that nuisance will help the Pats a great deal.","Are the Seahawks still a top-notch outfit?","With Pete Carroll as coach they are always in the mix, but the team lacks discipline and self-awareness.","Can the Chiefs get over the hump?","Andy Reid needs to have a Tony Dungy-type moment for that to happen. Kansas City has the pieces in place, but every part of the team needs to elevate its performance.","How will the Raiders do as slow-motion lame ducks?","x",""

He could easily be the best if he fixes that.","Honestly we are being spoiled rotten by the talent of receivers.","That and gets an actual quarterback who gives him the ball endlessly.","I would say we are in the midst of some of the best receiver play in recent history.","Definitely. You have Green, Beckham, Jones, Hopkins and so much more.","Who do you think is the best receiver in the league?","I definitely think it's a close call between Green and Julio. I would give the edge to Julio.","Does Julio get that edge over Green because of their playoff run?","To be honest yeah. Julio was completely unstoppable the entire playoffs.","That one catch in the Superbowl was freakish.","x",""

Winning a Super Bowl is a team accomplishment; many great QBs had to carry their teams.","So you're saying someone like Dan Marino shouldn't be left out just because the rest of the Dolphins couldn't get it together enough to pull off the big win?","Exactly. Marino had some amazing stats and even held the touchdown record at one point.","Still, if you HAD to make a list, where would you start?","I suppose the current obvious choice for a top pick is Tom Brady.","That man is a machine. Hardly feels like he's been aging atl.","x",""

There were lots of great playoff games and couple blowouts. Saints vs 49ers, Steelers vs Broncos, Giants - Packers, Giants - 49ers, Ravens - Patriots, Giants Patriots  Even the blowouts were fun, Brady had like 5 TD passes before halftime vs the Broncos.","Brees also set the single season pass yardage record that year, which Peyton obviously broke (by one yard actually) in 2013.","And only missed out on MVP by Rodgers having one of the best QB seasons of all time, throwing 45 touchdowns and 6 interceptions with 122.5 passer rating.","And Eli was the only super bowl winning qb to throw for 4900 yards in the season when he won the Super Bowl.","I'm just waiting for Jameis Winston to win MVP this next season so every fucking NFCS QB has an MVP but the actual best QB in the division's history.","I'm with this guy this year has a very special place in my heart for some reasons.

Of course it's not sustainable to win with a guy who passes like that, but he does have a particular set of skills that helped him win games in exciting ways.","Having the best defense in the league and an easy schedule helped him win games.","Packers-Cowboys used to be vicious","Uh, we definitely didn't have the best defense in the league that year. A lot of things contributed to Tebowmania: luck, Matt Prater, clutch defense, etc., but you can't overlook the fact that we were coming off a 4-12 season and were 1-4 when he took over, and we ended up winning the division and a playoff game with Tebow.","Honestly, now that Elliot and Prescott are showing signs of being something special, I'm feeling it again. Still nowhere near the Seahawks rivalry, but it could get there.","49ers and Cowboys is another one","I kinda miss having a rivalry with the Colts, it looked like Luck was going the same way of Manning when we played in the playoffs two years in a row, but the last two seasons the Colts regressed pretty hard.","I've said before it wasn't a colts-pats rivalry, it was a Manning-Brady rivalry, and it just transferred to the Broncos. For some reason people tried to say I was just salty about it.. when at that point the Patriots had won the last 3 games by a combined 90 points or something ridiculous like that.","The Patriots and Colts were rivals long before Brady and Manning. You do know they used to be in the same division, right? That rivalry goes back to like the 60's.","That doesn't mean they were rivals. People pointed out how ""funny"" it was that their rivalry didn't start until the colts left the division constantly back before 2011 when Peyton left.  Are the bills rivals with the titans because they were in the same AFL division?","The Pats-Colts rivalry was born when Willie McGinest stopped Edgerrin James at the 1.
