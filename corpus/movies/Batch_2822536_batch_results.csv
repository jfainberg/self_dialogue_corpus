That's a a good pairing. I'll give Before I Fall a watch this weekend!","Well, I watched this really interesting movie called, Before I Fall. It stars Zoey Deutch, Halston Sage, and this young actor I've seen before but can't recall his name.","Oh, I really like Zoey Deutch. Did you know she's Lea Thompson's daughter? You remember her right, from Back to the Future, Howard the Duck, a lot of great 80's movies.","Yes! I did know that. Ever since being introduced to her in Vampire Academy and learning a bit about her background I've been trying to catch all her films. She's doing great and appearing in a lot of notable movies currently!","So tell me about this movie, Before I Fall!","That's right, well let me tell you, this movie is quite the mind bender. It'll keep you guessing how things will play out and it will definitely entertain you the whole way through.","Is this a drama or more of a mystery thriller? I haven't caught one of those in awhile.","This is a little of both, I'd also add in fantasy to it. It's based on a popular novel by Lauren Oliver, and this story basically centers around a teen girl who basically has to live the same day over and over again!"

The Hateful Eight is worth it though, because the clues and smoking guns are so obvious and plentiful that your heart is on edge throughout the entire movie.","So are there protagonists in the movie?","There are, but it's hard to tell who they are, because everyone of the group of eight has a reason not to trust the other, and you have a reason not to trust them.","You know I like mystery movies like that, so give me an example of one of the clues?","Well, one of the most interesting clues is a piece of candy which Jackson sees on the floor during a casual conversation."

He was a former rough rider who took it upon himself to go out during and after the war to hunt black people.","That makes sense- I can imagine that there were tons of people who were not happy with the outcome.","Yeah, but this guy meets up with Jackson, and there seems to be a lot of animosity between the two of them. Jackson hates him for being a rough rider, and the sheriff hates him for being black.","Do they have a professional relationship?","Sort of, I guess they do. The sheriff is the one who pays out to all bounty hunters, and Jackson is a bounty hunter who is bringing in three claims."
