I mean, not every movie of his is my favorite, but he definitely made some classics.","I was thinking the same thing. We should find some Mel Brooks fans who've never seen it because they'd probably really get a kick out of it.","Sure did.  I don't think anyone would argue that Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein aren't brilliant.","Absolutely, those are two of the best.  No matter how many times I watch them, they make me laugh.","Well, you can't beat the casts in both of them.  Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, they're all great.","Oh, the best.  I love Harvey Korman, too.  I thought he was so terrific in Blazing Saddles.","I also liked him a lot in High Anxiety.","Yup, me too.  I'd consider that one of the less appreciated of Mel's movies.

Robin Williams did a great job and so did Robert DeNiro as the patient.","Sure, the doctor tried a new medication to see if it would help his ward of catatonic patients and one by one they came conscious and were able to move around.","any for the first time in years.  They were able to act and feel normal again but it only lasted for a few months and they sadly regressed back to their old state as the medication wore off.","Yes it was based on a true story.  At least they had a few months of an almost normal life albeit in a mental institution.","I also liked Rainman with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.  Dustin did an awesome job of playing an autistic man that had incredible memory and math talents.","Yes it was pretty comical at times and brought out some of the issues of special needs people at the time.  I liked the part where he wouldn't fly on the plane because he knew of all of the accidents of all the airlines.  I think he would only fly El Al because of no accidents but it did not fly where they needed to go.","Yeah, They went in their recently deceased father's old Buick cross country and had many adventures along the way.","Sure, I liked the part where they stopped in Vegas and Dustin was able to choose the correct cards and games and won a huge amount of money for his brother.","Yes, the casino didn't like that they were winning so much and thought they were cheating.  I think they put them out accusing them of card counting which I guess is illegal.","I like historical type movies and dramas of real life situations.  I enjoyed the movie Das Boot for that reason.","Not before Rainman won enough money for his brother to pay off his big debts and they made their getaway.  I love it when the small guy wins.","Yes that was an old one and showed what it was like from the other side.  Those guys sure did party to the max and had very short lives in the end.","Yes, I liked the part where they had been sunk down over 900 feet and had to fix all kinds of things and finally were able to surface as the air was running out. Scary stuff.","They really showed the personalities of the men and the person who provided the information used in the movie wrote the book about it and had lived through all of the incidents depicted.  Just when they thought they might be safely home they were bombed and many were killed and the boat sunk again.","First hand accounts can be pretty exciting.  I like street dramas too.  Did you see On the Corner ?","Yes the movie about all the people living on a ghetto street trying to survive?  It gave a real human face to the struggles of the people there and how many of them had to struggle with addiction.","Sure, and the limited opportunities available and the education so hard to get there.  Some were able to fight their way out but most did not have the resources and had to find ways to survive.","That was a real eye opener.  Another movie I liked was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  It was comical and sad all at the same time.","",""

Like Hook, for instance. I know a lot of people like that one, but it's one of my least favorite.","Yeah, you and I agree on that one. I thought it was annoying, to be honest.

I guess if I really had to pick one out of all the ones I like, it would probably have to be Steven Spielberg.","Oh sure, he's one of my top favorites too. When you start thinking about his movies, there are just so many amazing iconic films.","Definitely. I go all the way back to Close Encounters as one of my first all time favorite films.","That's an amazing movie. Really ahead of its time and really epic in scope.","Wasn't it? Such an original idea back and then to do a movie about alien visitors who weren't evil or out to destroy us.","Yeah, that's what blew me away.

Have you ever tried cleaning anything out of real wood?","I guess it was a little unrealistic.","I would not have been able to look past something like that.

Why didn't they kill the old man?","They said he looked ""authentic"" so they kept him alive to make their story of being random travelers who didn't know each other more believable.","Jamie Fox was a badass in Django. He was killing everyone. So that's how it was in this movie?","Okay, that really sounds pointless.","No, I would not say it was like that. Yeah, he was tough- I can't think of a role he has played in which he was not tough.","How about the house slave in Django?","That was a different kind of tough in that movie- he ruled the roost. Anyway, in this movie he comes off as a detective- imagine if Sherlock Holmes was from the hood.","He was trying to solve a crime?","No, but throughout the movie, everything is pretty much happening inside of one location, and he is really familiar with that location. The place has small quirks about it here and there and throughout the movie he is in the background putting clues together.","So a crime did occur in the place he was in?","Actually, yes. They were in a cabin, and it turns out that earlier in the day several people inside of the cabin were murdered.","",""
