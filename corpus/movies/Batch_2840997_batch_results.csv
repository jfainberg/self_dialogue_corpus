The meat of the story was heavily centered on personal development and exploring the new powers as well as friendship.","it sounds like they did a good job in making the movie a bit more thoughtful and not just a superficial summer blockbuster action flick.","Yes, I watched it last night.","Yes, I actually really enjoyed that aspect of it. I really grew to like the characters and so when the action started I really rooted and pulled for them. You'll enjoy the movie. They did it right!","What did you think about the movie? I'm thinking about watching it this weekend.","I really enjoyed it. Growing up as a Power Rangers fan, I thought they did a really good job with this movie.","So would you say they represented the Power Rangers well with this new cast and how they made the movie?","I would say so. I really enjoyed the new young cast they chose for the modern day Power Rangers. They mixed up some of the characteristics but it still held onto the same essence of what we know about the Power Rangers.","What do you mean they mixed up some of the characteristics?","Well remember the original power rangers had Trini and Kimberly as the Yellow and Pink Rangers. Trini was Asian. In the movie Trini is not Asian and so the Asian represented Ranger was the black ranger this time and he was male.","Oh that's interesting. So they made the black ranger Asian.

I'm really more interested in the movie since I loved the 1995 Animation as well as the manga book on it.","I read the manga and also saw the original. I thought the movie did a very accurate and good job in presenting the materials.

Her back story as well as some of the key points that made her character so interesting in the manga?","They certainly did.

I really enjoyed the musical score from Hans Zimmer too. It was such a classic Hans score.","That was such an epic score! It got me all revved up especially during that last race in Tokyo.

He's basically following her and then picked up something she dropped and introduced himself to her.

I forgot who the writer was but the story was just very poorly paced, and the tone was just up and done.
