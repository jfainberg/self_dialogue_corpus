Can you explain?","When the Ming Dynasty was overthrown, the Ch'ing Dynasty took over and devastated China. Many secret rebellion societies formed in temples that taught martial arts as self-defense. The Ch'ings sought and killed most of them, but the survivors passed on the tradition of martial arts.","Okay, but what does this have to do with the movies?","One of the ways they kept the tradition of Martial Arts was through story telling, first in Chinese Opera, and later in film.

They are often choreographed by real students of martial arts.","Okay, but how can you enjoy the traditions while listening to those silly voice dubs?","Those dubs are actually done by a British company called Omni Productions, who did many of the voice overs for martial arts movies, as well as Godzilla films and even some anime. That's why you hear the same voices over and over in those movies.","I didn't know all that. That all gives me a new appreciation for the films.

Usually sequels let me down after making me wait for them to be released.","I totally get what you're saying, but this one was definitely good. It might even be funnier than the first one.","I love that! I always thought one of the best aspects of the first Guardians movie was how much I was laughing when I saw it.","Oh, if you thought that one was funny, you HAVE to see Deadpool.","Is that the one with Ryan Reynolds? I remember seeing trailers for it.","Yeah, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and it's literally the most hilarious superhero movie to come out yet, in my opinion.","I'll definitely have to add that to my list of movies to check out."
