They're kind of disappointing, but not so bad that it's fun to make fun of them.","Yeah, I see what you mean. I don't know why they keep trying to do the grim dark stuff.","I think it's because most Hollywood people think superheroes are stupid and childish, but if they can make a dark movie they can at least pretend they're making a deep movie.","These movies are lovely dark and deep? Is this your Robert Frost theory of movies?","Well, I think there's a psychological association there.

His wife didn't even like him, how they expalined relations in real world would have been prostitution.","Maybe, but he was tipped off by returning cast, Ferrell's character could hear the writer simultaniuously, so wouldn't that have actually put him in charge?","there in lies the tick, is free will really free?

Truman yes but Ferrell, the narrator heard and wrote all his thoughts and actions.","No, if she had, she would have had to hve been there, but instead she wrote them and he heard her inner monologue as she wrote."
