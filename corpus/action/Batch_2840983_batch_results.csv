The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.","I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting. The story line itself was a mess.","I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise. Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.","That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films. I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.","I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent. Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.","I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?","Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest. John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role."

His line ""Go ahead make my day"" was a classic tough guy line used by many afterwards.","Then he had some comedy/action movies with ""Every which way but loose"".  Pretty funny with the primate co star.
