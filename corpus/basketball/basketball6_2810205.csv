We both agree he'll be every bit as good next year.","Yeah but he'll want to retire while he's on top.","Do you think we'll view Lebron as the greatest player ever.","I am. It's exciting but it makes the games leading up to the Finals really boring.","It depends on these next five years. If he wins 2 more championships, I believe we have to.","I know. There hasn't been a competitive series that has involved those teams.","It's great for the league to have two really good teams, but it makes the playoffs worse until the finals.","And it'll probably be the same next year. I can't see Lebron declining anytime soon.","The guy never gets injured and never loses any of his athleticism.","How old is he?","He's going to be 33 by next year. Most NBA players start slowing down after 30.","The most impressive thing about Lebron is his durability."
