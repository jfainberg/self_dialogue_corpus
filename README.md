### Using the data
* `corpus` contains the raw CSVs from Amazon Mechanical Turk, sorted by individual tasks (topics);
* `blocked_workers.txt` lists workers who did not comply with the requirements of the tasks, these are omitted by default;
* `get_data.py` is a preprocessing script which will format the CSVs into text (by default saved to `dialogues`), along with various options (see below).

#### `get_data.py`
Example usage: `python get_data.py`. This will by default read from `corpus` and write to `dialogues`. 

Optional arguments:
* `--inDir` Directory to read corpus from
* `--outDir` Directory to write processed files 
* `--output-naming` whether to name output files with integers (`integer`) or by assignment_id (`assignment_id`);
* `--remove-punctuation` removes punctuation from the output;
* `--set-case` sets case of output to `original`, `upper` or `lower`;
* `--exclude-topic` excludes any of the topics (or subdirectories of `corpus`), e.g. `--exclude-topic music`;
* `--include-only` includes only the given topics, e.g. `--include-only music`.
